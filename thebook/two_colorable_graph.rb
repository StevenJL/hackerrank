# A graph can be said to be 'two-colorable' if each vertex in the graph can be assigned a color such that no two adjacent
# vertices in the graph are assigned the same color.
#
# Returns true if the graph containing startNode can be colored with only two colors, and false otherwise
# The graph containing startNode can be assumed to be uncolored (getColor() returning null for all GraphNodes)
# in its initial state, and undirected (if a GraphNode A has B in its neighbor set, then B has A in its neighbor set)

# Implement this: public boolean is_two_colorable (GraphNode startNode)
