# given an arrya of numbers see if you can get to index with 0
# in it from an index by jumping through the array using the
# values in the array. So if you have [1,2,1,0,3] you can get
# to 0, from 0 by jumping 0, you can get to 0 from 3, by jumping
# 3 index down to 2 and then jumping 2 index up to 0...
